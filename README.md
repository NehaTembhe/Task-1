# Task-1
# Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes sales data to identify key insights, trends, and patterns. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to gain meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is **sales_data_sample.csv**, which contains the following columns:
- `ORDERNUMBER`: Unique order identifier
- `ORDERDATE`: Date of the order
- `SALES`: Total sales amount per order
- `PRODUCTLINE`: Product category
- `CITY`: City where the order was placed
- `COUNTRY`: Country where the order was placed
- `DEALSIZE`: Size classification of the order (Small, Medium, Large)
- `MSRP`: Manufacturer's suggested retail price

## Analysis Performed
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
   - Checking for missing values
   - Understanding the structure of the dataset
2. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Summary statistics of numerical columns
3. **Visualizations**
   - Sales trends over time
   - Sales by product category
   - Sales by city and country
   - Profit margin analysis by product line
   - Order status distribution
4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identifying top-selling products and regions
   - Observing seasonal trends in sales
   - Understanding profit margins for different product lines

## How to Use
### Requirements
- Google Colab (preferred) or Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Steps to Run
1. Upload **sales_data_sample.csv** to Google Colab.
2. Open the **Sales Analysis Notebook**.
3. Run all the cells to generate insights and visualizations.
4. Interpret the graphs and conclusions in the final report section.

## Output
- Bar charts and line plots for sales trends
- Profit margin analysis per product line
- Order distribution insights
- Data-driven recommendations

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing predictive analytics for sales forecasting
- Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior
- Incorporating interactive dashboards using Streamlit or Power BI
